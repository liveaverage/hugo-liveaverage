Me:**

I&#8217;m a married IT/IS Data Center Manager for a Lockheed Martin in Colorado Springs, CO, previously employed as an Infrastructure Designer & Administrator for the City of Gainesville & City of Alachua. I enjoy working, silence, FOSS & FOSS-integration, mixing vinyl when time permits, sport bikes, and coffee, lots of well-rounded coffee. I also have a tendency to dabble in web development & application development every now-and-then&#8230;
