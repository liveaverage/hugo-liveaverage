Ok, I used four lines, but my needs for retention might be a bit more complex than most. I also spaced each pipeline command, so it looks longer than it should, but readability is important. Additionally, there&#8217;s a good half-page of comments in the script than can safely be ignored, unless you _want_ to know what was going through my mind. Most of these related directly to my desired retention periods.

For testing purposes, the last two &#8220;lines&#8221; only print out the listing of files that would be deleted.
