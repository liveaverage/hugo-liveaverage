After deploying a few <a title="Looking for Shuttle KPC K45 Systems? Look no further than Newegg." href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16856101069" target="_blank">Shuttle KPC K45 systems</a> for UTM (Unified Threat Management) appliances using Untangle 5.42 and 6.00 I got tired of fussing with Shuttle&#8217;s MyKover JPEG template(s) and opted to create my own to-scale Word Document template. Feel free to change the included background image and text, I just left that on there for reference. And yes, the screw hole markings are correctly (or nearly correctly) placed.

I enjoyed the coffee cover included with the barebone system, but opted for something customized that would allow remote clients to phone in service-calls with all the important information (Local/WAN IP, MAC, FQDN, etc.) required for troubleshooting. Hope this helps someone out who might be looking for a better template than the one provided by Shuttle&#8217;s site.
