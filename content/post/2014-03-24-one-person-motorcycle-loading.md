I researched the expensive solutions from LoadAll and deemed it unnecessarily complicated (with far too many moving parts) for my taste. I also didn&#8217;t want to sacrifice my truck cargo space. I decided on the <a title="Two different sizes, but both are plenty wide at 40 inches." href="http://www.discountramps.com/black-widow-motorcycle-ramp.htm" target="_blank">40&#8243; wide, 8 ft. long Black Widow Ramp from DiscountRamps.com</a> combined with the <a title="Can't go wrong with the price on this motorcycle stand/chock." href="http://www.harborfreight.com/motorcycle-stand-wheel-chock-97841.html" target="_blank">Harbor Freight Motorcycle Stand/Wheel Chock</a> (not permanently mounted &#8212; temporarily secured with ratchet straps). Although I&#8217;m only loading my 2007 GSXR600 (a whopping 354 lbs.) and occasionally my 2012 Hayabusa (still relatively light at 573 lbs.),  this ramp could easily handle my parents&#8217; 2007 Harley FLHX Street Glide or 2012 Harley Sportster.

### The Ramp

[<img class="alignright" src="http://liveaverage.com/wp-content/themes/mimbo2.2/images/BG_Load-Medium-1024x682.jpg" alt="BG_Load (Medium)" width="257" height="172" />][2]The <a title="Two different sizes, but both are plenty wide at 40 inches." href="http://www.discountramps.com/black-widow-motorcycle-ramp.htm" target="_blank">40&#8243; wide, 8 ft. long Black Widow Ramp from DiscountRamps.com</a> is plenty long so the incline isn&#8217;t too steep, even when loading or unloading on a flat surface. It&#8217;s also wide enough to accommodate load-up mishaps requiring both feet down for immediate stabilization.

### The Chock

Yes, <a title="Can't go wrong with the price on this motorcycle stand/chock." href="http://www.harborfreight.com/motorcycle-stand-wheel-chock-97841.html" target="_blank">Harbor Freight&#8217;s Motorcycle Stand/Wheel Chock</a> is cheap and generic, but it gets the job done and I&#8217;ve never had an issue with it. I can&#8217;t say how it holds up to the elements since I remove it from my truck bed when not in use, but I&#8217;ve never had a doubt about its ability to hold my bike steady while it&#8217;s getting strapped-in for a ride.

I didn&#8217;t opt for a permanent mount solution. I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to drill through the truck bed. All of the motorcycle strap support should be pulling **down** and **forward** (towards the front of the truck and chock), so once the bike is IN the chock then a permanent mount isn&#8217;t really necessary. I also run a strap through the rear passenger peg supports (also pulling **down **and only slightly back). To secure the chock for unloading, I ran ratchet straps through its frame pulling it toward the front of the truck. This will keep things held down while you rock the bike out of the chock.

### The Extra Mile

[<img class="alignleft" src="http://liveaverage.com/wp-content/themes/mimbo2.2/images/BG_Ready-Medium-1024x682.jpg" alt="BG_Ready (Medium)" width="300" height="200" />][3] If you still need some cargo room and some added security, consider a truck bed extender. I picked up a nice <a title="Amp Truck Bed Extender" href="http://www.amazon.com/AMP-Research-74813-01A-Extender-2007-12/dp/B00AECRADE/ref=sr_1_7?s=automotive&ie=UTF8&qid=1395669075&sr=1-7&keywords=amp+truck+bed+extender+tundra" target="_blank">Amp Research Truck Bed Extender</a> from Amazon. This gives me a little extra cargo space and some added security with regard to towing (peace of mind) _and_ theft prevention. The extender can lock into your truck gate&#8217;s hardware, which can then be locked with a key. Sure, somebody could cut the straps holding the extender in place, but it&#8217;s one more step for a would-be thief.
