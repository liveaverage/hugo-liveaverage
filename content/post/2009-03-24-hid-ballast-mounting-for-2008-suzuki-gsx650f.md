Figured I’d post a few helpful pictures for any other GSXF enthusiasts looking to install HID lighting on their 2008 Suzuki GSX650F. I chose to use a pre-existing, pre-drilled location for mounting the HID ballasts. To make certain vibration and movement of the ballasts is kept to minimum I secured the mounting brackets directly to frame using heavy-duty zipties (two ties for each ballast bracket). You will need to drill holes in _both_ plastic caps. However, I ended up cutting and later butt-splicing the HID power connector for the low-beam because the hole size required was too large for the small size of the weather proof fixture cover. _Make certain your weather seals (if included with the kit) fit snuggly in the hole(s) you drilled:_&#160;

Notice the top [black] screw between the two electrical connections. That’s simply used to secure a portion of the front-fairing to the bike frame. It fit the bracket slot perfectly (no modification required). Make sure to get the zip ties nice and tight to avoid ballast vibration. Also make sure you have a solid ground connection for both HID lights or you may notice flickering (while stationary or moving).

For a point of reference, I used the cheap HID conversion kits (for automobiles, actually) from <a href="http://www.vvme.com/catalog/list-s-10145-10146.html" target="_blank">VVME.com</a>. It was about $60US with shipping. And yes, for a few ($5US) extra bucks they mixed-matched the bulb types so you don’t have to purchase two separate HID conversion kits. <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Xenon-HID-CONVERSION-KIT-H1-H3-H4-H7-H11-9005-9006-9007_W0QQitemZ190294857485QQcmdZViewItemQQptZCar_Electronics_Parts_Accessories?hash=item190294857485&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_trkparms=72%3A1171|66%3A2|65%3A12|39%3A1|240%3A1309|301%3A1|293%3A1|294%3A50" target="_blank">Check the original eBay link for more information.</a>
