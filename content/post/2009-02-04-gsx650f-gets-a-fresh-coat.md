So what’s been going through the booth at <a title="Check out what WetLixx.com has been up to..." href="http://wetlixx.com" target="_blank">WetLixx Custom Design + Paint</a>? Well, my spanking new 2008 GSX650F just got its first coat of yellow, along with a complimenting metallic finish. The image (left) shows the bike with it’s fairings temporarily mounted for a quick design tape-off. No clear coat has been applied, but you can certainly see the pearl/metallic finish. The conceptual sketches are soon to follow, along with images of the design.
