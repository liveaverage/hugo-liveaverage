After lots of tedious taping for the PCB (Printed Circuit Board) patterns on the fairings + tank, Chad @ WetLixx completed a full re-design of my 2008 GSX650F. It got a great reception from other GSX650F riders (<a title="Great feedback from the GSX650F Forum" href="http://www.gsx650f.biz/custom-paint-job-circuit-tech-look-2008-gsx650f-t1085.html" target="_blank">as found here: http://www.gsx650f.biz/custom-paint-job-circuit-tech-look-2008-gsx650f-t1085.html</a>). I&#8217;ll grab some more pictures of the bike once I finish hard-wiring my brain to the throttle for more instantaneous response times =)
