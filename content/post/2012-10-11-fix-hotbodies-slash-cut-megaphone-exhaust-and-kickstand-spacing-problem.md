I recently purchased a set of Hotbodies Slash-cut megaphone exhausts (dual) for my 2012 Suzuki Hayabusa. They sound beautiful, and other drivers are actually aware of my presence, unlike riding with the stock cans. The only issue I&#8217;ve experienced is the spacing between the kickstand [in the UP position] and the LH (Driver-side) slip-on exhaust. The kickstand essentially hits the exhaust before it&#8217;s in the full UP position. This also prevented the kickstand pressure safety switch from recognizing the kickstand was actually UP, resulting in stall-outs shifting into 1st gear from neutral [by design].

I contacted the manufacturer who suggested adding a spacer between the kickstand and bike, but this suggestion was useless&#8230; There isn&#8217;t any space between the kickstand and kickstand bracket [that mounts to the chassis]. I added spacers/washers between the kickstand bracket and chassis, but that accomplished nothing&#8230; It only permitted the kickstand to hit the exhaust at a HIGHER, more noticeable contact point. Spacing the bracket/kickstand also raised concerns about adequate support for the bike when leaned over; moving it further out created more of a lean. I didn&#8217;t feel comfortable pursuing this solution.

Someone on Hayabusa.org mentioned mounting/welding a nut to the kickstand nub that engages/disengages the kickstand safety switch. I ended up pursuing this, but with a bit more elegance. Parts list [obtained from Home Depot]:

  * Cap Screw (2-pack) #8-32 x 1/2&#8243; Stainless Steel
  * Bonded Sealing Washers #8 Galvanized (4-pack) 
      * Plain steel/galvanized #8 washers will do. I wanted something to seal the drilled-out hole to prevent corrosion.
  * Cap Nut (6-pack) #8-32 Zinc 
      * Galvanized would have been preferred, but I couldn&#8217;t locate them. I needed something rounded (button-top) to slide/push-in on the safety switch. It&#8217;s not perfect, but it does the job.
  * Thread-lock

Steps:

  1. Use chock and rear-stand to support the bike.
  2. Remove kickstand from bike. You don&#8217;t need to remove the kickstand bracket, just the kickstand (one nut, one bolt, and the spring set)
  3. Using a 5/32 drill bit, _carefully_ drill the tab/nub on the kickstand. Use a decent bit to avoid skating/slips.
  4. You can reinstall the kickstand (recommended) or choose to install the cap screw/bolt, washers, and cap nut before you remount the kickstand.
  5. Make sure the cap nut is installed facing up [when the kickstand is down]. This should protrude enough to engage/disengage the safety switch AND keep your kickstand from touching the exhaust.
