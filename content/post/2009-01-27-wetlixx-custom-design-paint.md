My very talented friend at WetLixx (http://www.wetlixx.com) decided to promote his dynamic art work (on a variety of cars, trucks, motorcycles, golf carts, etc.) by collaborating on a new, custom web showcase for his past and current projects. His primary focus is custom designs and paint jobs on motorcycles (cruiser and sportbike varieties) and golf carts, but he&#8217;s established himself as an accomplished artist on all mediums. Be sure to check out his site if you&#8217;re in the market for some &#8216;moving art,&#8217; on your vehicle.
