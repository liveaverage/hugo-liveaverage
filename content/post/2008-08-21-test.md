Just returned from a great orientation held in D.C. for departing American students on the CBYX (Congress Bundestag Youth Exchange) program. CIEE (Council on International Educational Exchanges) manages the exchange program, along with the great orientation(s) in D.C. A few <a title="CBYX Pre-Departure Orientation Photos" href="http://averageanalogs.com/cb2008" target="_blank">pictures of the event have been posted</a> at AverageAnalogs.com, a sister site.
